# üß† Snowflake Data Warehousing Project | Instacart Dataset üõí

# Overview / Introduction 
This project demonstrates how to build a modern data warehouse pipeline using Snowflake and AWS S3. It follows the classic ETL approach (Extract ‚Üí Transform ‚Üí Load), converting raw CSV data into meaningful insights by creating dimensional models and performing deep data analysis

# üì¶ Data Source & Storage 
# Staging Setup in Snowflake
```
CREATE STAGE my_stage 
URL="s3://dw-snowflake-course-imran/instacart/"
CREDENTIALS=(AWS_KEY_ID='XXXX' AWS_SECRET_KEY='XXXX');
```
# üßæ File Format Configuration
```
CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT csv_file_format 
TYPE='CSV'
FIELD_DELIMITER=',' 
SKIP_HEADER=1 
FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY='"';
```
# üèóÔ∏è Raw Data Tables (Staging Area)
## We load the following CSVs from S3 into Snowflake raw tables:

* Aisles

* Departments

* Products

* Orders

```
CREATE TABLE aisles (
  aisle_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  aisle VARCHAR
);
COPY INTO aisles FROM @my_stage/aisles.csv FILE_FORMAT=(FORMAT_NAME='csv_file_format');
```
# üß± Dimensional Modeling (Star Schema)
# Creating meaningful dimension and fact tables for optimized analytics:

# üìò Dimensions:
* dim_users

* dim_products

* dim_departments

* dim_orders

* dim_aisles

* üìä Fact Table:
# dim_fact_order_product ‚Äì Combines products, users, departments, and orders into a powerful analytical hub.

# Order_Products

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE dim_fact_order_product AS
SELECT 
  op.order_id, 
  p.product_id, 
  o.user_id,

# üìà Business Insights & Analytics
# üßÆ Total Number of Products Ordered Per Department

```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_no_products_order, d.deparment

JOIN dim_departments d ON fop.department_id = d.department_id
GROUP BY d.deparment;

# üîÅ Top 5 Aisles with Highest Reordered Products 

#  Query to find the top 5 aisles with the highest number of reordered products:
```

select * from dim_aisles

select * from dim_fact_order_product

select asi.aisle, count(*) as higjest_no_re_order  from dim_fact_order_product fop join dim_aisles asi on fop.aisle_id=asi.aisle_id where fop.reordered=TRUE group by asi.aisle order by higjest_no_re_order desc limit 5 ;
